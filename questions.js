// 1. Factorials!

// Return the factorial of the provided integer.

// If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

// Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

// 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

// e.g.

// factorialize(5) // returns 120
// Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function.

function factorialize(num) {
  // Well... welcome to the Unknown
